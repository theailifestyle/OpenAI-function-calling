I would like to conduct two searches in parallel. First, use search_google_shopping to find options for a [specific item], such as a 'wireless keyboard'. Secondly, simultaneously use search_google_local to search for [type of local stores], like 'electronics stores', near [specified location or zipcode]. Please execute both searches at the same time. Once the results are available, show me the shopping results for the 'wireless keyboard' first, followed by the results for local 'electronics stores' in the specified area. Assume I will display the result of the functions below the chat. just respond with a friendly here you go.
